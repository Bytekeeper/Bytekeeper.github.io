Following suit, I jumped back in time to already have a game project on-going for quite some time now.
A bad habit of mine is to reach some milestone and then &ldquo;pause&rdquo; (drop) the project.
But now I&rsquo;ll return to it, and as a small incentive to keep on it, I&rsquo;ll start this blog.</p>
<p>As with Sonko, this means my StarCraft AI related projects are on hold (don&rsquo;t worry, the <a href="https://www.basil-ladder.net/">basil ladder</a> will keep running).</p>
<p>Also, on a rather technical note: I dropped Jekyll as a static site generator and moved to <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">zola</a>. Every Jekyll upgrade wasted a lot of time to get it running again. Zola is just one binary, and it should run fine on github actions as well.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Orion_II%3A_Battle_at_Antares">Master of Orion 2</a> (MOO for now) a lot when I was younger.
Even back then I tried to create my own clone of the game.
But the scale of the game was a bit to much for me back then - maybe even today.</p>
<p>But not all thing were good. It irked me a bit how much the game slowed down in the later phases due to the massive amount of micro-management.</p>
<p>Fast forward some 30 years and some more MOO games. I always was a fan of easy to learn hard to master games.
Almost none of the games inspired by it (or being successor to) seem to do that. They just upped the complexity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Airman&rsquo;s Odyssey</li>
</ul>
<p>{{ fit_img(path=&ldquo;rotpr.png&rdquo;, alt=&ldquo;Remnants of the Precursors&rdquo;) }}
Remnants of the Precursors (ROTPR for now) has a simple interface. Maybe even a bit to bland. But it gets the job done. I did not really play the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Orion">Master of Orion</a>, I was still <del>wasting</del> enjoying my time with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)">Civilization</a>.</p>
<p>I do like the simpler colony management, which avoids going through every colony in the mid-late game. Spying is a bit strange, it is not really obvious what multiple networks and/or high spendings are doing.</p>
<p>{{ fit_img(path=&ldquo;moo2.jpg&rdquo;, alt=&ldquo;Master of Orion 2&rdquo;) }}
Master of Orion 2 (not 1) is a bit different, more complex in some aspects (colony management) and less so in others (less diplomacy/spying).</p>
<p>The UI is a bit dated, and looks only good when shrunk down. Still looks nice though.</p>
<h1 id="designing-my-game">Designing My Game</h1>
<p>My game already has quite a lot of code, but barely anything to show.
I decided to create the game abstraction in code as a first step. This was a mistake in my opinion.
While its clear that the inner game model should be sound, only testing it via unit tests is rather dull.</p>
<p>It currently covers the basics of building ships and colonizing other systems.
Like any software architecture, it is best to delay the choices which &ldquo;cost&rdquo; the most - as long as possible.
This might sound unintuitive, but help not wasting a huge amount of time due to some bad &ldquo;large&rdquo; initial decisions.</p>
<p>Although I got some basics covered, I want to explore design space a bit further before continuing/refactoring.</p>
<p>I know a few things I <em>want</em> in the game design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Colonization should be per star system (like ROTPR). Colonizing individual planets really takes its toll on usability. Multiple different factions owning each a planet in a system? A separate UI for planets in a system? It just makes things more tedious.</li>
<li>Research based on a RPG like skill tree. Even ROTPR, which tries to make research meaningful succumbs to the &ldquo;unimportant research item&rdquo; problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>{{ fit_img(path=&ldquo;tech_tree.dot.png&rdquo;, alt=&ldquo;Tech tree like skill tree&rdquo;, caption=&ldquo;Imagine some more tier levels here&hellip;&rdquo;) }}</p>
<p>Tech items above are just examples (for some I don&rsquo;t have an idea on what they do), I do want to make it unconventional - yet useful. Every tech has 3 upgrades which will improve on the previous state in one way or the other.</p>
<p>Ideas for unconventional techs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fanatics - For every upgrade, establish a colony on any unoccupied star system</li>
<li>Boost - Increase productivity of a single colony for a short while</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideas for more conventional techs:</p>
<ul>
<li>XYZ Armor - Unlocks a type of armor, further upgrades improve efficiency</li>
<li>XYZ Weapons - Unlocks a type of weapon, further upgrades improve efficiency</li>
<li>Productive - Increases productivity per upgrade level</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the real change comes with the way you unlock techs. Usually, you designate a research topic and after some turns you&rsquo;ll get it. This is not the case here.</p>
<p>Instead, you build up research points - and once you have enough you can immediately unlock or upgrade a tech.
This allows for fast reaction to new circumstances. There are also only a very limited amount of techs to unlock. With either, MOO2 or ROTPR I always feel like the actual decision of what to research matters little. Yes, some do - but you can always replace them later with something else. I want the player to be able to focus on a certain play style, stick to it, but still be able to win.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for today!</p>
