It works fine if the game ends with the in-game timeout of 60min, since the Tournament Module BASIL uses
will make both bots leave and select the winner based on the score (That might be unfair, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another post).">

It usually runs fine nowadays. But sometimes an external hiccup occurs. One of those is the problem of detecting who to blame if a game times out.
It works fine if the game ends with the in-game timeout of 60min, since the <a href="https://github.com/basil-ladder/sc-tm">Tournament Module</a> BASIL uses
will make both bots leave and select the winner based on the score (That might be unfair, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another post).</p>
<p>But if a game gets killed because it took to long (wall-clock time), what then? There are no scores, no replays - nothing essentially.
Besides a bot just hanging, most bots just take their time. So I wanted to penalize the slower bot in that case. This looked like a good idea back
in the beginning. For <code>dll</code> bots this works fine, but for <code>client</code> bots, it didn&rsquo;t work up until <a href="https://github.com/bwapi/bwapi/commit/4a984290cf6aa6f05ebcbdcd4a094ffceb57f6e9">BWAPI 4.4</a>.</p>
<p>As of today that means that games timing out in that fashion will not be counted. One could abuse this by timing out intentionally for imminent losses.
I don&rsquo;t expect this to happen, the bot community is generally competitive, but also friendly and fair. (Totally unrelated: I can actually disable bots permanently)</p>
