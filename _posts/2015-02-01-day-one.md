Day One is a strategy game about you building up a nation. You build, you research, and you eXterminate. And you do all of this in one quarter of your screen!

Day One focuses on strategy and tactics. It follows the footsteps of 4X games, but does things slightly different. It's the story of your nation struggling against 3 other competitiors.
You know where they are. Resources are scarce. There's no time to waste.

The game consists of the screen being split up in 4 quadrants. Each quadrant may be occupied by a player's nation. Troop movement and positioning is simplified, in that you only have
a limited number of places your troops (or you enemy's troops) can be. Researching and construction of building is also crucial. Will you put more people into the work force, to speed up production? Or will you focus on research, to gain a technological edge? All the while, keep in mind that you have to feed your people as well!

Here is a short mockup of how it might look like:

Now, why "this"? I love strategy games, especially [4X games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X). You build up an empire an squash your enemies (well some games can end peacefully as well).

What sometimes bothers me is the scaling problem:
While almost all games start out with pretty quick gameplay, including the turn based ones, it slows down considerably after a while.
And after some time it's more or less a huge amount of micromanagement to stay effective.
So my requirements for my own game had to look like this:

* Realtime with high tension
* Micromanagement of a very limited amount of units
* Macromanagement of just one "colony"
* Research, which is fun but missing from most RTS games
* Buildings, mostly the result of research, to improve the nation or build units
* Units, with specific abilities and impact on other units in an area

That's it for now, back to developing...
