I decided to enter [Ludum Dare 36](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/), although I had only limited time. Here's a screenshot of my entry:

And if you want you can [grab it](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/?action=preview&uid=43153) and play it. Source code is on github.

Making of
=========
The tools I used:
* GIMP (programmer art)
* LMMS (programmer music) and a lot of plugins
* Intellij IDEA
* libGDX
* Gradle

I want to focus on aspect of the game making process, I really liked:

Animation or how to make fluent quasi-random movement using (co-)sine
---------------------------------------------------------------------
All animations are programmed. Including the bumping of the car and wheel.

Basically all animations are based on `cos(x)`:

Now the fun part comes when you add multiple cosine at different frequencies and different amplitudes. As with most procedural generation, this is done in ever increasing 
frequencies and decreasing amplitudes. But since our source function is **not** random, using a factor of 2 for both would result in a too smooth wave:

This image shows 2 added octaves.

Factors like 2 are just bad when used in this context, as `cos(0)` == `cos(PI * 2)`. So lets use a factor that won't match so soon, like 1.7:
![Cosine 1.7](/assets/2016-09-01/cos_1_7.png)
 
Repeat this a few times and this is the result (this time x's range is 0 to 50):

![Cosine 1.7^4](/assets/2016-09-01/cos_1_7_times_4.png)

If you had done this with octaves of factor 2, it'd look like this:

![Cosine 2^4](/assets/2016-09-01/cos_octave_times_4.png)


As you can see, that looks pretty regular, while the first one still looks like a wave, but a random one.

If you have played the game you might have noticed, the car, the wheel, the body and the head wobble a bit different - but always in the same general direction.
The fun thing about the formula is that it is a continuous and smooth function. Points *behind* and *after* the current point are not jumping around.
In my game, I'm using it to make the body and head "follow" the movement of the chariot.
 
 
Ok. Enough math for now.
