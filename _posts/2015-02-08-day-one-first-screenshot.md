This is how it looks currently. Ugly programmer art and all. The "units" actually move randomly around.
I'll show this in a later post. As you can see it's a little crowded it there, which is just me having fun watching randomly moving wobbling stuff.

The basic layout is set - as a player, you won't see all those grids. Only those where you have actually units deposited, will be visible for you.

On the lefthand side you can see the strategic part of the game. This is where you decide on what to build and the focus of your economy. The three sliders represent:
* Farmers
* Workers
* Scientists
They determine, what part of your population will take action in that particular trade. Moving one slider up reduces the other two sliders and vice versa.

Reduce farmers too much and your population will suffer food shortages. Reduce workers too much and you will have to wait for ages an your new builings. You might not even have enough income to pay for them. Keep your population out of science and your swordsmen will fight against hover tanks.

Below the economy section lies the construction section. There you can build units, structures and upgrade them as well. The research section is not yet prototyped, but will follow soon.

Oh and for more about programmer art, here's a larger version of my "soldier" placeholder:
