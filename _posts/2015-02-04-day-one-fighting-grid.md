This is a small mockup on what combat looks like:
![Popcorn is missing](/assets/DayOneFightingGrid.png)

Units are placed on a grid in the border areas between players. The middle area is carnage with all 4 players being able to deposit units.

Units can be moved on the grid in realtime, while moving they can not attack. If moved to an occupied square (with another unit of the player) - they switch places.

The circles in the image show the attack range of normal units. Some units will have a higher range, while others will be able to attack several squares at once.

As long as you got units in an border attack area, no player can enter your inner circle defense from there. This inner defense is now a larger space instead of multiple small ones:

If you have no more defenders left, enemy units can choose to destroy buildings, steal your credits or food supplies. They can also see your buildings, and might be able to deduce your strategy. 
Even the presence of enemies with the area will lead to penalities like efficiency being decreased.

More things that might come:

* Construction on borders to affect the combat within:
    * Turrets
    * Shields
* Hero units with special area of effect "skills"
* Support units
* Defense only units

Enough talking, more coding...
