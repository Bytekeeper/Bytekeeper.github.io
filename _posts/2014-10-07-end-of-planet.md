The title is actually wrong. I can't remember the frist game I made, it was
some (long) time ago. Some years ago I also started modding. You might even have seen [Defence Alliance](http://www.moddb.com/mods/defence-alliance) or [Defence Alliance 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/35420/).
But back to *End Of Planet*:
[![A falling bomb](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/393934/43153-shot0.png "This is you - falling")](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/minild-54/?action=preview&uid=43153)
A quite simple game which involves you, dropping into the crater of a planet you intend to destroy. "Why?" you ask - well you're a bomb duh!

Although not the best code I've written so far, you can still check out the source code and all content (ugly but self-made) at [GitHub](https://github.com/Bytekeeper/MLD54/).
