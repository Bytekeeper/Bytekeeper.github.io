          <description xml:base="https://www.bytekeeper.org/basil-timeouts/">&lt;p&gt;If you haven&#x27;t yet, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;basil.bytekeeper.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;BASIL&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It&#x27;s a 24&#x2F;7 Starcraft league, but for bots!
It usually runs fine nowadays. But sometimes an external hiccup occurs. One of those is the problem of detecting who to blame if a game times out.
It works fine if the game ends with the in-game timeout of 60min, since the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;basil-ladder&#x2F;sc-tm&quot;&gt;Tournament Module&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; BASIL uses
will make both bots leave and select the winner based on the score (That might be unfair, but that&#x27;s a topic for another post).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if a game gets killed because it took to long (wall-clock time), what then? There are no scores, no replays - nothing essentially.
Besides a bot just hanging, most bots just take their time. So I wanted to penalize the slower bot in that case. This looked like a good idea back
in the beginning. For &lt;code&gt;dll&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; bots this works fine, but for &lt;code&gt;client&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; bots, it didn&#x27;t work up until &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bwapi&#x2F;bwapi&#x2F;commit&#x2F;4a984290cf6aa6f05ebcbdcd4a094ffceb57f6e9&quot;&gt;BWAPI 4.4&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today that means that games timing out in that fashion will not be counted. One could abuse this by timing out intentionally for imminent losses.
I don&#x27;t expect this to happen, the bot community is generally competitive, but also friendly and fair. (Totally unrelated: I can actually disable bots permanently)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
