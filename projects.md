# Projects

## Starcraft Broodwar AI related

[Basil](https://basil.bytekeeper.org/)
My league for Starcraft Broodwar AI players. The engine code is [open source](https://github.com/basil-ladder/basil).

[sc-docker](https://github.com/basil-ladder/sc-docker)
My fork from [sc-docker](https://github.com/Games-and-Simulations/sc-docker), a docker container to run bot games in Starcraft. Test-proven by running 24/7 as the work horse of Basil.

[StyxZ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link starcraft/StyxZ.md %})
My bot playing on Basil and [SSCAIT]. It's also [open source](https://github.com/Bytekeeper/bw_bot_ftt)!

[ASS](https://github.com/JavaBWAPI/ass)
My (contributors welcome!) Java Broodwar AI library. Combat sim&#10004;, clustering&#10004;, spatial querying&#10004;, ...

[JBWAPI](https://github.com/JavaBWAPI/JBWAPI)
I'm part of the team bringing [BWAPI] to the Java world. There are alternative libraries, but this one is currently the only actively developed.

## Build tooling

[Whisk](https://github.com/Bytekeeper/whisk)
Like programming languages, everyone needs one today. Build task dependency graph base build tool based on a small DSL. Build *only* what is required to reach a goal.

## Game Dev

[Eternal Space](https://github.com/Bytekeeper/EternalSpace)
POC game based on the game [Endless sky]. Not really in a playable state, better use the original.

[Some Ludum Dare games](https://ldjam.com/)
I did enter some lds. With lacking artistic skills and mostly fragmented time the results are so-so.

## General Tools

[STT](https://github.com/SimpleTimeTracking/StandaloneClient)
SimpleTimeTracking - based on the idea of [ti](http://ti.sharats.me/). Allows to track times without much overhead. No calender dropdowns etc., everthing is based on simple commands. Backed by a simple text file as "database".


## Electronics

Bedlight
Using an ESP8266, some sensors and a LED stripe: Avoid requiring to turn on the lights in the bed room. Automatically fade in a low red light at night when standing up. Wake up by pulsing light, and provide bright light when entering the room if required.
