I think I don't really need to explain what a 4X game is, maybe not even what the 4X stand for.
But, I'll do it anyway - the gameplay loop of a typical 4X game is:
* eXplore
* eXpand
* eXploit
* eXterminate

Much of the fun of this simple formula comes from the fact that none of those factors stands on its own.
You usually cannot expand without exploring first. Sometimes to expand by exterminating an enemy at a location first.
What is there to exploit, if you did not expand before?
And how will you exterminate, if you lack the resources you ought to have exploited first.

Let's dive deeper into the ~~abyss~~ parts of such a game:

# Exploration
The most basic approach is sending out scouts. An alternative would be spying.
Maybe diplomacy uncovers some secrets as well.

# Expansion
Again, there's the direct way of sending a colony ship (settler). Alternatively you can take over an enemy colony.
A random encounter could grant you a new colony.

# Exploitation
Pumping up the population. Building factories. Gather food. There could be a lot of resources to be gathered.
Also things like research are part of this.
There are also hidden resources. A large army could incline neighbours for that large tribute.

# Extermination
Send your force and crush your foes. Or let your spies sabotage the heck out of them. Or let some allies or vassals handle it.
