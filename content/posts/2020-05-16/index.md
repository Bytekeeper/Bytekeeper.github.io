This was meant to be a tech related blog, mostly for Broodwar AI related stuff and private projects. Since private projects are included, I guess one could call my son a private project.

Screaming into the light, he was born in late February. His name is Benjamin, which I am certain means horse-dung in some weird language. I do not care, go away! And due to Corona, we have been left alone for most of the time since then.

My last blog entry was in January, and up until now I really did not have the energy to write a new article. But since most of my free time is now reserved for serving the little demon, I'll just write about what 
I know best now: My spawn. Prepare for many picture which may or may not include my son (hint: nope, no pix from him - maybe in a later post).

As with all babies, he is cute (actually I believe mostly parents find most babies cute, for my part they look like french baguettes mostly...). If you remember Tamagochi, it is really its human form.

Lucky for me, we have a spare room - otherwise working would be very hard due to missing shut-eye. Which means shift 1 is work, shift 2 is work, shift 3 is sleep. And things like *this* mostly eat into shift 3.

A little human goes through a lot of development phases. There is the cute phase...

Then there is the crying phase...

And there is the default happy phase

OK, the last one might be slightly exaggerated. And it is not the default. At least for my son, most of the time he is pretty happy.

You are supposed to react to the baby's needs. Ignore that at your own peril (eardrums). Really, a lot of time I look at my son and this is what I see:

I believe the general baby package works like this:
* You receive it
* It comes un-boxed, without manual - W.T.H.?
* It must already be defect, or is it supposed to behave this way
* Your midwife (its common to have one here) tells you a lot of good info, and a lot of mumbo-jumbo.
* She tells you what homeopathy "stuff" (I refuse to say medicine here) you can give you baby - that is ok, since placebo also works for babies. (Btw did you know, there is also a [nocebo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo) effect? Cool!)
* She tells you to see an osteopath (that is so much dumbfuckery). Uuuuhhhh magic energy waves uuuuhh
* You start to get a grip on it... or do you?

Thing is, the first few weeks you could care less. Your baby can see like 30cm (about 12in you strange people who stopped in time). It can't really focus or look at you.
After that it actually can focus you, which is good - it can now target practice with its sound-wave gun _while looking at you_.

Then it starts to smile at you. First for short periods of time, then more. It might also randomly switch from crying, screaming, and laughing.

We're currently within the Stan phase. What that is?

And with that, I will conclude today's *rant*.
