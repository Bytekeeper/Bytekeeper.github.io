That is Stoic with a capital "S".

# Externals
Externals are things that are not under your control. Maybe its the programming language you have to use. Or the system(s) it will run on.

They are there, and that is OK. But don't get attached too much. This also follows the general architectural recommendation to decide things as late as possible. This will also ensure that the software is not tightly coupled to something from the very beginning.

Some examples of externals in software:
* The programming language(s). The provider of any of them has some power over you. Maybe they suddenly change their licensing model.
* Dependencies. The more dependencies you add, the worse it gets. Maintainers can stop development on them at any time.
* Outsourcing or contracting. They might be gone tomorrow, and they take the knowledge with them. Or dictate new conditions, one-sided.
* Build infrastructure. The provider of those also have some power over you. Become too attached to one and every change they make will give you a very hard time.
